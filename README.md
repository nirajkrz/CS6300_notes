# CS6300_notes

unofficial notes for CS6300.
Many thanks to **Shipra De**, one of the students who took the class in Fall 2014, for creating them!

Important disclaimer: These notes were created by a student without any help or input from teaching staff, so staff does not officially endorse them 
and just provide them as is, hoping that you find them useful. 

Feel free to let me know how you like them and whether you have any comments or feedback, which I will be happy to relay to Shipra.
